# Wave

In this section we're going to introduce you to an important concept in C4: Animations. We'll also show you how to work with gradients and timers to create a wave effect. When we're done, we'll show you how to tweak a single line of code to get some different aesthetics out of the example.


## Animations
We don't `draw{}` here. C4 lets you create animations by working with properties, while letting its underlying engine do the heavy-lifting for you.
